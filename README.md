# Overview

I wrote this Discord bot, it can play youtube videos on a discord voice chat and keep track of bets and counts on a dictionary list.
I made this for me and my friends because we needed a bot to keep track of our constant bets and a bot that's able to play any youtube video,
since a lot of bots have a time limiter and won't play any videos longer than 3 hours I made this one so we could do that exact thing.

# Development Environment
I used Visual Studio Code, and the discord.py API, youtube_dl, asyncio, functools, and itertools libraries.

# Future Work


* I plan on bettering the process of adding and adding to new bets.
* Also hosting all of the bets in a cloud database.
* After that, I plan on hosting the bot on the cloud and making it public.
